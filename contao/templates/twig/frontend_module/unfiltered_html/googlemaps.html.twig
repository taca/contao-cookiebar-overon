  ** Add changes to the base template here. **

  Hint: Try adjusting blocks and attributes instead of
  overwriting the whole template. This way your version
  can remain compatible with future changes to the base
  template as well as adjustments made by extensions.

  Currently available blocks:
    "editor_view", "html"

  Example:
    {% block editor_view %}
       {{ parent() }}
       My additional content for 'editor_view'â€¦
    {% endblock %}
#}
